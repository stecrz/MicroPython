    # Sets up a motion switch based on Analog Devices ADXL362 accelerometer to wake up from deepsleep.
    #
    # The ADXL362, operating at a frequency of <freq> Hz (in 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400), sets the INT2 pin
    # to HIGH if it detects a motion for at least <samp_act> samples. The motion is triggered by a
    # strength/acceleration greater than <tresh_act> mg (less = more sensitive) and is finished (no
    # motion detected anymore) when the strength falls back below <thresh_inact> mg for at least
    # <samp_inact> samples. <freq> is also known as output data rate ODR.
    #
    # Samples depend on frequency. E.g. when frequency is 100, this means there are 100 samples a second.
    # => Increasing frequency means you have to increase <samp_..> as well.
    # In wakeup mode (not used right now) frequency is always 6, meaning ~5-6 samples per second.
    #
    # Measurement range <mrange> is one of (2, 4, 8) g, where 2 ist the most sensitive (but smaller value
    # range).
